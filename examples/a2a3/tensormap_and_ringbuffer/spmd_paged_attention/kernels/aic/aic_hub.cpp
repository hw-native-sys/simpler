// AIC Hub Kernel - No-op stub used as the AIC slot of MIX (AIC+AIV0+AIV1) tasks
// when the real work happens only on the two AIVs (softmax, online update).
// Pairing an idle AIC with two active AIVs forces the scheduler to allocate a
// full cluster, which is what enables the two AIV lanes to run in parallel.
